Hello there. This is the front page: you can edit this text in `index.md`.

Instead of typing in raw HTML you can type in Markdown, which is a lot easier.

There is a list of posts that follows, which (I think) is automatically generated by the theme. The current theme is called `hamilton`, and I think there are quite a few available. The theme can be changed or customised in the `_config.yml` file (there you can also change information such as that in the footer).
