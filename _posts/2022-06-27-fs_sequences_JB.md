A simple post grouping my work on frequency-swept pulse sequences:

 - [poster overview](https://foroozandehgroup.github.io/assets/documents/fs_sequences_poster.pdf)
 - publications: [CHORUS & ESR](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0038511), [Improved design of frequency-swept pulse sequences](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2022.107146)
 - toolboxes for pulse generation and simulation: [MRChirpLab](https://github.com/foroozandehgroup/MRChirpLab) for MATLAB (used for articles work), [mrpypulse](https://github.com/foroozandehgroup/mrpypulse) for Python (less complete)
