You can inspect the original Markdown source code for this post to see how things are done.

-----------------

**Code blocks**

{% raw %}
Note that the syntax highlighting is a Liquid feature, not a Markdown feature. Liquid is kind of a HTML templating "language" and is recognisable by the `{% ... %}` directives in the source code.
{% endraw %}
<!-- I need this "raw"/"endraw" to make Liquid NOT parse the curly brace-percent combination. -->

Here's an example of Python syntax highlighting. If you type the following code in your Markdown file:

{% raw %}
    {% highlight python %}
    def fib(n):
        # this is mildly inefficient because if you call fib(1000)
        # followed by fib(1001) it has to calculate the first 1000
        # elements twice.
        fibs = [0, 1]
        if n > 1:
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                fibs.append(fibs[i - 1] + fibs[i - 2])
        return fibs[n]
    {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

It will be rendered in the final webpage as:

{% highlight python %}
def fib(n):
    # this is mildly inefficient because if you call fib(1000)
    # followed by fib(1001) it has to calculate the first 1000
    # elements twice.
    fibs = [0, 1]
    if n > 1:
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            fibs.append(fibs[i - 1] + fibs[i - 2])
    return fibs[n]
{% endhighlight %}

You can do other languages as well, here Haskell (simply swap `highlight python` for `highlight haskell`):

{% highlight haskell %}
fibs :: [Int]
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
-- actually this is more like a Python generator than a list
-- because of lazy evaluation. It also doesn't suffer from the
-- Python problem: once the first 1000 elements are calculated
-- they're there forever

fib :: Int -> Int
fib n = fibs !! n   -- !! is the indexing operator
{% endhighlight %}

**Math can be rendered with MathJax**

(which is mostly like LaTeX, except that you cannot load arbitrary packages)

This doesn't come by default, I added a JavaScript link to the website header (you can see it in `_includes/head.html`).

If you type:

`$$\mathrm{i}\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\Psi\rangle = \hat{H}|\Psi\rangle$$`

you can get:

$$\mathrm{i}\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\Psi\rangle = \hat{H}|\Psi\rangle$$

The `mhchem` package works but unlike in LaTeX you need to use math mode (otherwise it won't be parsed by MathJax):

`$$\ce{H2O <=> H+ + OH-}$$`

$$\ce{H2O <=> H+ + OH-}$$
